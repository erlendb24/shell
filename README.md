# Shell

## Commands
Commands use UNIX names with a 't' at the start to differenciate between the
global commands in PATH and my own built-in or external program(ls).

Use 
```shell
   shell
``` to start the shell.

```shell
   shell
   tls 
   tls -a
   tls -l
   tls -al
   tls -la
   tcd <dir>
   tpwd
   techo <string>
   texit
```
